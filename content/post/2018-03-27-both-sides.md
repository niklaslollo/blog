In my last rant, I wrote that the narrative "both sides do it" is itself toxic. We need to diagnose the problem correctly before we can hope to solve it.  

And the problem is the fucking Republicans.

Without further ado, this post hopes to catalogue the ways in which the GOP and right wing politics have corroded our political system.   

  1. **Climate change** - For about 30 years, Republicans have consistently denied science, impugned the credibility of scientists, [actively promoted coal and oil](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/8/25/16201218/us-coal-industry-handouts), prevented the COP21 agreement from being stringent, saddled future generations with worse climate, ignored the pleas of the rest of the world, and more.  
  2. **Conspiracies** - Republicans continually and relentlessly push conspiracy stories such as Pizzagate, Seth Rich, Barack Obama's citizenship, the Parkland students as paid actors, climate change as a Chinese hoax, [the phony IRS Scandal](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-11-20/gop-surrenders-cherished-irs-scandal-at-last), and so much more.
  + **Endless bad faith** - Republicans claim that they care about certain principles when they impugn Democrats, but their bankrupt political plays are (at the same time) transparent-as-hell as well as revealed soon thereafter. Thus, bad faith. Examples include, oh, [Hillary's emails!!](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/24/jared-kushner-private-email-white-house-243071), calling on Democrats to return Harvey Weinstein's money, and then not doing the same for Steve Wynn (a much bigger GOP financier than Weinstein was for the Democrats), voting before seating Doug Jones when Democrats allowed Scott Walker to be seated before ACA vote.
  + **Amazingly fucked-up legislative process around health care** - This is another major bad faith example, but it deserves a full line-item. Republicans whined endlessly about how the ACA was being rushed through. Yeah, what a crock of shit. The [ACA](https://newrepublic.com/article/144040/no-end-republicans-lies) [repeal](https://newrepublic.com/article/143699/medias-unacceptable-silence-republican-health-care-bill) [process](https://newrepublic.com/article/143579/conservatives-excuses-kicking-millions-off-health-care-dont-make-sense) was so much [worse](http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/343553-unhappy-senators-complain-about-healthcare-process), they don't belong in the same sentence.
