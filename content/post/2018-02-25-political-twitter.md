To start all this off, I won't be saying much of anything new, and it won't be a very long piece. That said, these are things that must be said over and over, and perhaps someone new will see. That would be enough for me.  

My point is: Donald Trump is clearly guilty. Of obstruction of justice, of "collusion," of grift, of nepotism, and of many more sad, disappointing, and enraging acts.  

But that is a bit trite, a bit tired. A more provocative statement would be: The Republican party is rotten, and its current form is truly its apotheosis. The GOP stands for its wealthy donors and class warfare. The GOP commits acts of endless bad faith, so much so that one doesn't need any fancy analytical framework to assess them. Basically, if the GOP casts aspersions about the Democrats, you can be 100% certain that the GOP has done that very thing and likely to a heightened degree. The most devastating part of the attack is that it pre-empts and handicaps the very valid statement that I just made.  

Nevertheless, this last comment, too, is a tad trite. What's more compelling is to look at the media coverage of "Washington." It is a bit unfortunate, but this one word, "Washington," encapsulates how poorly the media is at covering the Trump Administration and GOP politics. There are too many problems, but I'll list a few. 

The first problem is false symmetry. One needs to be batshit blind to think the GOP and Democrats are equivalent political machines. One would need to, for instance, equate poor email server practices, with extreme grift, nepotism, cronyism, collusion.  

The second problem is bad faith. The media consistently takes the GOP at its word when even a tiny shred of research or scrutiny would topple whatever house of cards was offered. Why is Kellyanne Conway allowed on TV still?   

The third problem is "he said, she said" reporting. This builds from the previous two points, and is basically this: the news is not what someone says, but the reality behind and around those words. It's not enough to simply say "Trump said X. He lied." The story is "The President lied to the people." That's it. So simple. The media could run that story back everyday and it wouldn't get old, because it would always be true.  

The fourth problem is letting the GOP outrage machine guide reporting.  

The fifth problem is missing the forest for the trees. Similar to point three, if you are going for a story, and the administration blocks you, guess what, you have your story. "White House lies again." Enough said.
